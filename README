## Overview ##

Toy application deployed into aws lambda. It is about TODOs

## The url ##
The url of the serverless app is `https://b5rxb1xn39.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/todos/`, of course it only has the `todos` operations on it

## The documentation ##
To generate it, run `npm run swagger-json` you will find your json spec inside dist as `swagger.json` with this file you can analyze it with your favorit openapi manager so you can see the documentation of it.

## Test ##
You can run them issuing the command `npx jest` and the test suit will follow, the test suit is derived from the documentation.

## Things that were not implemented ##
I left out the middleware for authorization & authentication, the other parts like the filtering by status and unit tests are implemented.
